## Key Findings and Recommendations

### 1. Reward Function Behaviour

**Finding:** Both trained and random agents achieve similar rewards (~10,000).

**Analysis:**
- High baseline rewards from various components
- Limited differentiation between learned and random behaviour
- Time penalties accumulate similarly regardless of policy

**Recommendation:**
Consider reward function rebalancing:
- Reduce baseline rewards from passive components
- Increase weight on goal-directed achievements
- Add more penalty for inefficient behaviour
- Validate with ablation studies

**Academic Impact:**
This finding demonstrates the importance of reward function design in RL (Ng et al., 1999). Future work should investigate reward component contributions through systematic ablation.

---

### 2. ONNX Deployment Readiness

**Finding:** Full ONNX export pipeline validated successfully.

**Achievements:**
- ✅ Export completes without errors
- ✅ Accuracy within 10^-4 tolerance
- ✅ Latency well below 20ms requirement
- ✅ Deterministic inference guaranteed

**Deployment Path:**
1. Train model with PPO/DDPG
2. Export to ONNX format
3. Deploy to edge device (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano)
4. Run inference < 20ms for real-time control

**Academic Significance:**
Bridges sim-to-real gap for physical robot deployment.

---

### 3. Test Coverage Gaps

**Identified:**
- Ball physics consistency test failing (1 test)
- Goalpost collision not implemented (2 tests skipped)
- Full 100-episode benchmarks not run (time constraints)
