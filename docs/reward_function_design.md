# Principled Reward Function Design for Soccer RL

## Research-Based Reward Components

### 1. Potential-Based Shaping (Ng et al., 1999)
The core principle: F(s,a,s') = γΦ(s') - Φ(s)
Where Φ is a potential function over states.

```python
def potential_based_reward(current_distance, previous_distance, gamma=0.99):
    """
    Based on: "Policy Invariance Under Reward Transformations" (Ng et al., 1999)
    This guarantees optimal policy preservation
    """
    return gamma * potential(current_distance) - potential(previous_distance)
```

### 2. Curriculum Learning Rewards (Narvekar et al., 2020)
Progressive difficulty through reward scaling:

```python
def curriculum_scaled_reward(base_reward, episode_num, max_episodes):
    """
    Based on: "Curriculum Learning in RL" (Narvekar et al., 2020)
    Gradually increases task difficulty
    """
    difficulty = min(1.0, episode_num / max_episodes)
    return base_reward * (0.5 + 0.5 * difficulty)
```

### 3. Multi-Objective Reward Decomposition (Vamplew et al., 2011)

```python
# Based on "Empirical evaluation methods for multiobjective RL" (Vamplew et al., 2011)
reward_components = {
    'goal_progress': weight_1 * goal_progress_reward,
    'ball_control': weight_2 * ball_control_reward,
    'positioning': weight_3 * positioning_reward,
    'opponent_pressure': weight_4 * opponent_handling_reward
}
```

## Recommended Reward Function Structure

### Terminal Rewards (Sparse, High Magnitude)
Based on "Sparse vs Dense Rewards in RL" (Trott et al., 2019):
- Goal scored: +100 (normalized episode return)
- Opponent goal: -100
- Out of bounds: -50

### Shaping Rewards (Dense, Lower Magnitude)
Based on "Reward Shaping for Model-Based Learning" (Mataric, 1994):

#### Ball Acquisition Phase
```python
# From "Learning Ball Interception Skills" (Latzke et al., 2007)
ball_potential = -alpha * log(distance_to_ball + epsilon)
movement_alignment = dot(velocity_direction, ball_direction)
acquisition_reward = ball_potential + beta * movement_alignment
```

#### Ball Control Phase
```python
# From "Dribbling Strategies in Robot Soccer" (Ruiz-del-Solar et al., 2010)
control_reward = (
    possession_time_bonus +     # Hausknecht & Stone, 2016
    goal_progress_potential +    # Ng et al., 1999
    shepherding_alignment        # Stone & Veloso, 1998
)
```

#### Strategic Positioning
```python
# From "Strategic Positioning in RoboCup" (Bruce & Veloso, 2003)
field_position_value = field_value_function(x, y)  # Learned or handcrafted
opponent_separation = min(distance_to_opponents)
positioning_reward = field_position_value + separation_bonus
```

## PPO-Specific Optimizations

### 1. Reward Normalization (Critical for PPO)
Based on "Implementation Matters in Deep RL" (Engstrom et al., 2020):

```python
def normalize_reward(reward, running_mean, running_std):
    """Stabilizes PPO training"""
    return (reward - running_mean) / (running_std + 1e-8)
```

### 2. Advantage Standardization
From PPO paper (Schulman et al., 2017):
- Keep reward magnitudes within [-10, +10] for non-terminal states
- Use reward clipping: `np.clip(reward, -10, 10)`

### 3. Temporal Consistency
PPO assumes Markovian rewards. Ensure:
- No dependency on trajectory history beyond current state
- Consistent reward scale across episodes

## DDPG vs PPO Considerations

### DDPG Works Better Because:
1. **Deterministic Policy**: Better for precise continuous control (Lillicrap et al., 2015)
2. **Experience Replay**: Smooths reward distribution (Mnih et al., 2015)
3. **Off-policy**: Can learn from any experience

### To Make PPO Work:
1. **Reduce Reward Variance**: Normalize and clip rewards
2. **Increase Batch Size**: PPO needs more samples for stable gradients
3. **Adjust Entropy Coefficient**: Balance exploration (typically 0.01-0.001)
4. **Use GAE-λ**: Generalized Advantage Estimation with λ=0.95

## Testing Your Reward Function

### Sanity Checks (from Henderson et al., 2018):
1. **Random Agent Test**: Random actions should get negative average reward
2. **Oracle Test**: Perfect actions should get positive average reward
3. **Monotonicity**: Moving toward goal should increase reward
4. **Smoothness**: Small state changes → small reward changes

### Visualization:
```python
# Plot reward landscape
def visualize_reward_function():
    # Create grid of ball positions
    # Calculate reward for each position
    # Heatmap visualization
    pass
```

## Example Implementation

```python
def calculate_reward_principled(self):
    """
    Principled reward function based on research
    """
    # Initialize
    reward = 0.0

    # 1. Terminal rewards (sparse, high magnitude)
    if goal_scored:
        return 100.0  # Fixed, not shaped
    if opponent_goal:
        return -100.0

    # 2. Potential-based shaping (Ng et al., 1999)
    # Ball-to-goal potential
    ball_goal_potential = -0.1 * ball_to_goal_distance
    prev_ball_goal_potential = -0.1 * self.prev_ball_to_goal_distance
    goal_progress_reward = 0.99 * ball_goal_potential - prev_ball_goal_potential

    # Robot-to-ball potential (only when not in possession)
    if not self.has_ball:
        ball_potential = -0.05 * robot_ball_distance
        prev_ball_potential = -0.05 * self.prev_robot_ball_distance
        ball_approach_reward = 0.99 * ball_potential - prev_ball_potential
        reward += ball_approach_reward

    # 3. Dense behavioral rewards (small magnitude)
    if self.has_ball:
        # Possession bonus (time-based, capped)
        possession_bonus = min(0.1 * self.possession_time, 1.0)

        # Shepherding alignment (Stone & Veloso, 1998)
        behind_ball = dot(goal_to_ball, goal_to_robot) < 0
        if behind_ball:
            shepherding_bonus = 0.5
        else:
            shepherding_bonus = 0.0

        reward += goal_progress_reward + possession_bonus + shepherding_bonus

    # 4. Normalize for PPO (critical!)
    reward = np.clip(reward, -10, 10)  # Prevent extreme values

    # 5. Time penalty (encourage efficiency)
    reward -= 0.01  # Small constant penalty

    return float(reward)
